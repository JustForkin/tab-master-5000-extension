Tab Master 5000 is free of cost and doesn't generate any revenue directly. If you are a happier Chrome user because of this extension, a donation will help me ration more time to this project. As a developer, I have to choose my time wisely, and while I love working on it, it is not always easy to sit down and improve the extension while I have other obligations.

If you are a developer and would like to contribute time to this project, you can submit pull requests to this project's master branch on Github.

Submitting bug reports and suggesting new features on Github or the Chrome Web Store is also helpful.

All contributors will be listed on this page after each extension update unless they opt out.

Thanks for using Tab Master!
