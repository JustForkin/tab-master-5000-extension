### FAQ

**How do I close all tabs from a specific domain?**

Right-click a tile, and a context menu with list of options will appear. Click "Close all tabs from..." to trigger this action.

**What happened to the option to remove duplicates from a certain domain?**

Having an option to remove duplicates from a certain website, and all duplicates seemed confusing and cluttered the context menu. My assumption is nobody intends to have any duplicate tabs, so that is now the only option. Pulsing duplicate tiles can be disabled in Preferences.

**Where did the tile drag icon go?**

Tile dragging has been overhauled in V2, and you can now drag a tile by simply holding the left mouse button and moving the tile to the selected position. This can also be done from the table view.

**How do I remove only certain tabs?**

This can be done in the table format view. Hold CTRL to select rows, or hold shift to select a range of rows. Then press the delete key. An option to delete selected items through the context menu, among other tab functions, will be added in an upcoming update.

**I switched to table view from the sidebar, and the tiles disappeared.**

Click outside the sidebar to exit it, and the table will appear. This bug is still being investigated.

**When I apply the sorted tab order from the sidebar, the extension becomes unresponsive.**

The method of applying tabs en masse hasn't changed since V1, and will be fixed in an upcoming update.

**I am experiencing performance issues.**

Try disabling screenshots, animations, session synchronization, or undoing of tab actions in Preferences. Enabling automatic tab discarding can also help improve performance on lower-end PCs.
